![Personal Expendable Text Area (PETA)](./docs/title.png)

This is like a notepad app but on browser and expendable, which stores data on local storage only. I usually need to take quick notes at work which I really don't want to save anywhere on my PC, so I was in need of something expendable.

### Things I used to make it

- The usual `HTML` and `CSS`
- Some `Tailwind` for styling
- `JavaScript` for storing stuff in local storage
